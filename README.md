## Lenovo Haswell Y50-70 patches by RehabMan

This set of patches/makefile can be used to patch your Lenovo Y50 DSDT/SSDTs.  It relies heavily on already existing laptop DSDT patches at github here: https://github.com/RehabMan/Laptop-DSDT-Patch.. There are also post install scripts that can be used to create and install the kexts the are required for this laptop series.
